                      personal information because it is very difficult to
                      verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless, upon your
                      request we will close your Account and remove your
                      personal information from view as soon as reasonably
                      possible based on your Account activity and in accordance
                      with applicable law. We do retain information from closed
                      Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud,
                      collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
                      problems, assist with any investigations of any Registered
                      User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any other actions
                      otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our
                      sole and absolute discretion. You should understand,
                      however, that once you publicly post a Request, Offer,
                      Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Website,
                      you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have
                      deleted or removed your Account, you agree that Bowoot
                      shall not be responsible for any personal information that
                      was not included within your deleted and/or removed
                      Account that remains on the Website.
